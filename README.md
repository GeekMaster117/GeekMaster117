# 👋 Hi, I'm Sai Venkat Chitturi
I have experience building Online Compilers, Self-hosted Servers, Neural Networks from Scratch, Personal AI OS, Game Engines, and Multiplayer Games.

## 🌐 Best Projects (Online & Internet-Facing)

### Online Compiler
Host your own Java Compiler online, just deploy the webapp in your Tomcat and done! Configure your security settings, and truly own the compiler.

### Self-hosted Image Storage
Host your own Image Storage, just deploy the container and done! No longer need to pay a monthly subscription fee to Google.

## 🖥️ Best Projects (Offline / Systems-Level)
### Personal AI OS
Monitors your activity, gives suggestions based on it, and builds automations based on suggestions. The best part, all of this is completely offline.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
### ASCII Engine
Handles simple ASCII art and physics-based simulations on command prompt. It can be used to create games or just visualisations of data. Available in both C and Java
